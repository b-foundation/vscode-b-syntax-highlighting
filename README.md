This package does not claim to complete covering of all the syntax constructions existing in B language specification, moreover, it does not try to fit to any implementation of this language. As additional it contains snippets for some kinds of blocks and statements.

## Installation

Go to your Visual Studio Code and open the 'Exteions' pane, then find the extension in Marketplace by typing of 'B Syntax highlighting' and press the 'Install' button.

Perhaps, you should restart you Visual Studio Code. Enjoy!
